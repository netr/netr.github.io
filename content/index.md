I've been programming since I was 13, learning in [AOL chatrooms](https://github.com/readme/featured/aol-programming-culture) by breaking things to understand how they work. I landed my first paid gig at 16 and have been solving problems ever since. I care less about specific languages or tech stacks and more about finding the right solution. While I prefer using the best tool for the job, I understand that's not always possible.

### Full-stack Developer

I'm a full-stack developer who's touched pretty much every major tech stack from the last 20 years. These days, I'm deep into:

- Distributed systems and system design
- Automating anything and everything that I can
- Building backends with Golang, Python, Node.js, and PHP
- Building frontends using React, TypeScript, and Next.js
- Architecting cloud solutions with AWS and Docker
- Learning about LLMs and AI and how they can improve my efficiency and performance

### Why Work With Me?

I love solving tough problems. With years of experience building applications from scratch and reverse engineering obfuscated code, I can quickly understand complex systems and codebases. Whether it's a greenfield or brownfield project, I get up to speed fast. One of my strong suits is debugging and fixing issues - I can keep complex builds in my head to track control flow and understand how data moves through systems.

### Primary Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Golang, Python, PHP, Javascript, Typescript
- **Frameworks:** Next.Js, React, Laravel, Django, TailwindCSS, ShadCN
- **Technologies:** SQL, NoSQL, Cloud, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Kafka
- **Certifications:** [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/1d42c051-5b2d-4dbc-858e-f3bc0cce64a3/public_url)
