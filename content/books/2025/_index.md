### What I'm Reading Right Now

- [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339) - *50%* - Science-backed book on how to improve software delivery performance. I forget where I heard about this book, but Martin Fowler seemingly approves of it.

- [Invisible Hook by Peter Leeson](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Hook-Hidden-Economics-Pirates/dp/0691150095) - *40%* - Looks at the economics of pirates and how they were able to create a functioning society. This book is so good. We've always loved pirate and glorified them in the movies and stories, but they're definitely not portrayed as being as democratic as they were. I'd suggest this book to anyone and everyone.

- [Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain by Sharon Begley](https://www.amazon.com/Train-Your-Mind-Change-Brain/dp/0345479890) - *50%* - Looks at the science behind neuroplasticity. There's a lot of mention of the Dalai Lama and Buddhism in this book, but it's not a religious book. It just describes scientific studies that were being presented to the Dalai Lama by neuroscientists. Heard about this book in a random tweet by [Yohei](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima) shortly after he released BabyAGI.

- [Diabolical Sword: An Urban Fantasy Mystery by Melissa Erin Jackson](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097D795WZ) - *10%* - My sister's first book of her 4 part series. I'm sorry Melissa, I'm a *bit* behind on reading these. I promise I'll finish it ASAP.

- [The Go-Giver by Bob Burg and John David Mann](https://www.amazon.com/Go-Giver-Expanded-Little-Powerful-Business-ebook/dp/B00YBBKLKS) - *50%* - I originally heard of this book on a Tim Ferriss podcast episode with Matt Mullenweg, I think? The same episode where I realized I wasn't alone in my madness of listening to the same song for hours on end while I build things. It's an easy read, which is the intention, I'm pretty sure. Beauty lies in simplicity.

- [The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416) - *10%* - Book I'm reading with my girlfriend, our first book club entry.

### My Upcoming Reads

- [Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications By Grady Booch et. al.](https://www.amazon.com/Shuttered-Secrets-Paranormal-Suspense-Mystery/dp/1736186604) - Saw Grady Booch on a podcast recently and was really impressed with his knowledge and breadth. I've definitely used UML before, but I'd sadly never heard of him before that. I got this book used on Amazon for ~$30. I'm excited to read more of it.

### Completed Book Reviews

- [Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) - **5/5** - This book was very difficult to get through, but I definitely understand why so many people talk about it. It has some decent examples, but I don't think you can get the full scope of what the book explains without consistently using its patterns and strategies in real projects. I had to take a lot of notes and make many Anki cards for it. Many modern technology paradigms seem to lean on DDD as the correct way to structure software and systems. Both the microservice patterns [book I read last year](/books/2024) and Accelerate have talked about its usefulness, not only in distributed system design but also in overall developer health within organizations. I'd recommend any software engineer read this book and really try to absorb the "why" behind each pattern and how they compound on each other. I think DDD fits particularly well with Golang, especially with its package structure. I'll come back to this book and use it as a reference for many years to come.
