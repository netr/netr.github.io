## Currently reading

1. [Invisible Hook by Peter Leeson](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Hook-Hidden-Economics-Pirates/dp/0691150095) - *30%* - Looks at the economics of pirates and how they were able to create a functioning society. This book is so good. We've always loved pirate and glorified them in the movies and stories, but they're definitely not portrayed as being as democratic as they were. I'd suggest this book to anyone and everyone.

2. [Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) - *20%*  - The blue book of DDD. I've been wanting to read this for a while now. Very abstract and theoretical so far, but I like that. Most problems you're trying to solve with programming aren't clear cut, so I think it's important to have a good understanding of the theory behind your choices.

3. [Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain by Sharon Begley](https://www.amazon.com/Train-Your-Mind-Change-Brain/dp/0345479890) - *50%* - Looks at the science behind neuroplasticity. There's a lot of mention of the Dalai Lama and Buddhism in this book, but it's not a religious book. It just describes scientific studies that were being presented to the Dalai Lama by neuroscientists. Heard about this book in a random tweet by [Yohei](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima) shortly after he released BabyAGI.

4. [Diabolical Sword: An Urban Fantasy Mystery by Melissa Erin Jackson](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097D795WZ) - *10%* - My sister's first book of her 4 part series. I'm sorry Melissa, I'm a *bit* behind on reading these. I promise I'll finish it ASAP.

5. [The Go-Giver by Bob Burg and John David Mann](https://www.amazon.com/Go-Giver-Expanded-Little-Powerful-Business-ebook/dp/B00YBBKLKS) - *50%* - I originally heard of this book on a Tim Ferriss podcast episode with Matt Mullenweg, I think? The same episode where I realized I wasn't alone in my madness of listening to the same song for hours on end while I build things. It's an easy read, which is the intention, I'm pretty sure. Beauty lies in simplicity.

## Next in the queue

1. [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339) - Science-backed book on how to improve software delivery performance. I forget where I heard about this book, but Martin Fowler seemingly approves of it.

2. [Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications By Grady Booch et. al.](https://www.amazon.com/Shuttered-Secrets-Paranormal-Suspense-Mystery/dp/1736186604) - Saw Grady Booch on a podcast recently and was really impressed with his knowledge and breadth. I've definitely used UML before, but I'd sadly never heard of him before that. I got this book used on Amazon for ~$30. I'm excited to read more of it.
