With YouTube and online content becoming more and more of a shallow and surface-level collection of native advertisements, I've been trying to get back into books. I've always loved reading, but especially with the rise of the "influencer", and self-proclaimed experts, trying to sell courses; I've found myself really craving the depth and thoughtfulness that comes from a good book. While I'm mainly using this as a reference for myself, I hope it can eventually provide good recommendations for others.
